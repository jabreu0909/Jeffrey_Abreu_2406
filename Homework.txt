Jeffrey Abreu – Homework #1Scenario 1: no flashdrive,using a public computer. Assuming a github repository already exists, explain the steps necessary modify a file that already exists in the repository.Steps:-Open the github command line-Navigate to the directory you wish to use to work on your files	-cd desktop-Pull down a copy of your repository by using the clone command	-git clone https://github.com/squash_addict/ramy_ashour_2406.git-Navigate to the cloned repository	-cd ramy_ashour_2406-You can open the text file in the command line by using the following command	-vim requirements_analysis.txt-Make changes to the file by pressing the “i” key on your keyboard-Press the “Esc” key to return to Normal mode and then type in “:wq” to save and quit-Type in this command to stage the new edited file for upload to repository	-git add requirements_analysis.txt-This command is for committing to the changes made and add a comment to help you remember what changes were made	-git commit –m “I can hit better cross-court backhand shots than you in squash”-This command will upload it to the online repository	-git push –u origin masterScenario 2: using a private computer. Assuming a github repository already exists but isn’t currently on the laptop in question, explain the steps necessary to remove a file from the project.-Open the github command line- Navigate to the directory you wish to use to work on your files	-cd desktopPull down a copy of your repository by using the clone command	-git clone https://github.com/squash_addict/ramy_ashour_2406.git-Navigate to the cloned repository	-cd ramy_ashour_2406-If you want to remove the file from both the repo and the local system use the following set of commands	-git rm file.txt	-git push origin master-If you want to remove the file only from the repository and keep it on the local file system use the following set of commands	-git rm --cached file.txt	-git push origin masterScenario 3: copy of repository on flash drive, using a public computer. Assuming you already have a copy of your repository on a flash drive, explain the steps necessary to add a new file to the project.-Open the github command line-Navigate to the flash drive directory using the below command	-In Mac		-CD flashdrivename  --Usually capitalized but can confirm by running the command “cd /Volumes && ls”	-In Windows		-cd “driveletter”:    --without the quotes-Stage the new file in order to add to project	-git add hello.txt-Commit the changes with the new file added and add a comment to note what this commit was about.	-git commit –m “Initial commit-I am the best squash player in the world”-Tell git how to find your repository	-git remote add origin https://github.com/squash_addict/ramy_ashour_2406.git-Push your changes up to github repo	-git push –u origin masterScenario 4: two or more private computers, multiple participants. Assuming a github repository exists on several private computers and is being modified by various participants over time, explain the steps necessary for you to modify a file in the project. Assume that you’ve just been notified by one of your team members that they’ve just updated the project.-Open the github command line-Navigate to the working repository	-cd desktop/ramy_ashour_2406-Retrieve the latest update of the file by pulling the latest changes from the repository	-git pull origin master- You can open the text file in the command line by using the following command	-vim requirements_analysis.txt-Type in this command to stage the new edited file for upload to repository	-git add requirements_analysis.txt-This command is for committing to the changes made and add a comment to help you remember what changes were made	-git commit –m “I can play anytime”-This command will upload it to the online repository for others to pull the changes made	-git push –u origin master
