The Taxi Federation is the highest trending cab service and is a quick and reliable transportation application. We operate in over 50 countries worldwide. We collect 15% of each transaction our drivers make. We operate using GPS software to place drivers to nearby requesting clients, after the client chooses a location we then pair them with the closest driver.. After arriving at the desired destination all information such as time, place and distance traveled is stored as a record then the transaction ends.

Data Requirements
High Scale Computing: A distributed computing environment where the volume of data and the demand for specific types of workload can be accommodated quickly. 
WANS: Multiple cities containing WANS, preferably use 10 Gigabit Ethernet LAN PHY as it provides 10G bit/s, more than enough to accompany even thousands of clients simultaneously.
Throughput: Only a clients request and transaction will be packed and sent to through the server. One request consists of DriverID (5-6 INTâ€™s (4 bytes ea=8bits ea) = 40-48 bits, UserID (also  40-48 bits), location (5-20 characters = 50-160 bits), date and time(10 numbers = about 80 bits) in total adding up to approximately 340 bits for the request throughput of one client. The transaction consists of the same information as the request (340bits) in addition to transactionID and payment amount, which would go up to 550-600 bits of data. Since this operation would only launch in New York, estimating about 300 requests in an hour, the maximum number of requests simultaneously would be (300 requests/ 60 minutes = 5 a minute) so ideally and preferably having 10 servers would eliminate potential conflict.
Purpose: Keep record as proof/to gather raw data/create collective data.
Clients: Those requesting a taxi
Suppliers: Gas stations (exxon , BP,)
Businesses we rely on: Business specific credit cards 
Transactions: Multiple client requests responded to immediately, continuous and simultaneous flow of various driver/client before and after data transactions to store. 
Money made per transaction: Base fare + Time + Distance
Data Storage System: Data Warehouse
