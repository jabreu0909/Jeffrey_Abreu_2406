Technical FeasibilityWe require some math specialists in order to come up with an algorithm so that it not only radar the nearby drivers to the client but compute which one would be most efficient / or most effective. It is also essential to have some educated programmers to interact the algorithm with a program that processes options for the client, their choice, etc. As previously stated, the project should take up to a year if not more to complete. It will not be easy, but it is entirely possible.Economic FeasibilityThe Information in the scope definition is more or less accurate and remains the same. Operational FeasibilityThe system is definitely improved; no other cab company can do the unique platform we have created for multiple clients to be supported by one vehicle in a common destination. On top of this, driver and us make more money while saving the client money. Instances such as driver using less gas to get more people satisfied and the people are satisfied by paying less.
