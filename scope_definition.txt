Intent of project: To preserve time of drivers and money of clients, being as efficient as can be to use more if not all the space in the vehicle to satisfy more than 1 customers’ needs heading to the same direction at about the same time.
WHAT: What the new system is designed to do is, adding this extra feature would allow potential clients to drive with another passenger riding to a relatively similar destination. 
WHY: This would not only save passengers’ money making it more desirable for them to use us, but also make potential employees(drivers) eager to join us as we are to develop a feature not yet promoted by any other vehicle service company. Furthermore, it would create a more efficient environment where the quantity of requests is satisfied to benefit the passenger, and the driver.
HOW: Since our employee fee will remain 15% per completed ride, our mission is to have more drivers and requests for a ride.
Time frame: 1 Year (estimated in the budget section)
User interface
The Web / App modification shouldn’t take very long as it is the simplest part of the system, taking from a week – 3 weeks for each modification (App and Web) to not only be designed but hooked up to our new system. In total about a month in time for this part of the system.
Software
The most complex and complicated part of our system, first the mathematical experts would need to design an algorithm that connects 2 or more passenger requests to a relatively similar destination, and create the calculation of transaction to generate more profit for us and the driver, and deduct expenses for the passenger(s). This would require at least 8 months of creating and testing until the satisfactory result is achieved. At the same time, our programming team would need to cooperate with the mathematicians to understand their necessities, which ultimately depend on the success of this feature. However, without the software to drive these computations and calculations nothing would work so I estimate the same 8 months of time for this part of the project. Overall, I would predict that this would take from 9-11 months to link, test and make it function.
Data Storage
Our programmers and analytics would be discussing the software and hardware requirements, but ultimately how data storing would operate and queried. This part of the project is not the challenging part but it isn’t the easiest either, after deciding what soft/hard ware we intend to use, creating a data flow diagram, tables, and collective data queries would take approximately from 3-4 months with the included time of how we would implement it into the system.
Budget
4 Mathematical Experts:(100k x 4 = 400k x 9/12months = 300k) for algorithm, computations and calculations.
4 Senior Software Engineers: (4 x 150k = 600k x 9/12months =450k) for the building and linking of functionality from user interface through the software to our database.
2 College grad. Software Engineers: (100k a year x 2 = 200k x 9/12months = 150k) (college grads. for the Web/App user interface).
3 Data Analysists: (90k a year x 9/12months = 67500 per Analyst ) To interpret data, analyze results using their statistical techniques and provide reports; identify trends, filter and clean data and develop/implement data collection systems to optimize efficiency and data quality.
2 Analytics Managers: (100k salary) As Full time employers to our corporation, but for the project time ONLY (for 9 months) we would pay 75k. (for technical and organizational skills to identify and improve business structure / solutions for complications).
1 Scheduling Manager: (Salary from 30k-50k) We would hire for them for 9 months, paying the full 50k salary. (50k x 9/12months = 38k) (For scheduling of actions throughout project and to see through that the project is going accordingly with respect to time).
Software and Hardware components = 100k
TOTAL: 300k + 450k + 150k + 67k + 75k + 100k= $1,142,000
People in business: Owners, managers, drivers, programmers, and analysts
# of People in on the project: 16
People required for project: Senior and college graduates in Software Engineering, Data Analysts, Project Managers and Mathematicians.
